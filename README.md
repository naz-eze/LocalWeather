LocalWeather IOS8 Application.<br />
First ever IOS Application - so please don’t judge if my code doesn’t look well structured…<br />
Written in Swift.


How does it work - 
* App finds user’s location using their GPS
* Then talks to openweathermap.org’s API using this information
* Pulls down a JSON file containing the user’s weather details
* JSON is then parsed to grab all important/required weather information
* Weather values are then displayed on screen
* UI Background changes colour depending on the temperature value

** Currently only tested on the iPhone5. More tests on other screen sizes to follow
